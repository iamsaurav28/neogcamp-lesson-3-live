     <ul><p> <li><strong>G+3</strong>- it means ground floor and three other upper floors on it.
     </li></p>

        </li></P> 

    <P><li><strong> this is  </strong> a 2D drawing as u can see upper drawing its about ground floor,and other 3 upper floor are same.
     </li></P> 

     <P><li><strong> commands </strong> i have used to make this drawing are line, mirror, move, etc. </li></P>

     </ul>
     <img class="hero-img" src="images/section.jpg" />
     <h1> this image is know as section.</h1>
     <p> section means it shows u side and internal angles of drawing , and how many steels colums ,beams are needed to be  given to make a proper contruction.  .</p>
<ul><P><li><strong> footing </strong>- is base of building as u can down parts ,it should be strong so that it can easily pickup heaviness of building. and dont let it fall.
 </li></P> 
  <P><li><strong> things which are</strong>- used for footing u can see there are cement, khadi, reti, murun, all there are used in column and beams also.</li></P>

<h1> This pic is know as Elevation</h1>
<p> Elevation is all about outer look of our contructed building, it ll shows you hows the view of project look like front outside.</p>
<img class="hero-img" src="images/elevation.jpg" />

<ul><p><li><strong>this is final part</strong> of drawing in this u can clearly see how the project looks like at end.
</li></p>
<p><li><strong>this is not 2D </strong> drawing it is a 3D drawing which makes evrything look real and as per same we are gonna built on site.</li></p>
